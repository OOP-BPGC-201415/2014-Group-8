1)Positives of our group
People like Amit Gaiki already had knowledge of how to make a web app.He already knew about Spring framework.
Helped us to learn a lot.
Everyone helped each other and actively participated in making the whole project.


2)Negative of our group
Every work was done at the last moment.Even this txt file has been writtern at the last moment


What would we do differently next time?
Firstly since we all were new to spring and due to time constraint most coding part was done by Amit.
And secondly we could have included an ssl encryption or spring security to make it more secure.
Also we could make a version of the website for smartphones,so that less of data is used when accessing it from our phones.
